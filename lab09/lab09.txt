What good has this bundling done? How big is the new bundle file? 
Check the Chrome DevTools network log to see what files are being loaded.

<< It's definitley shrunk things. ?? >> The new bundle is 5.96 kB. For some reason, Chrome refuses to include base.css, but includes react.js, react-dom.js, browser.js, jquery.min.js, remarkable.min.js, and bundle.js

What role did Babel play in the bundling?

    Babel converts newer flavors of Javascript, Typescript, Elm or whatever into the older variants of Javascript that are supported by browsers.

Can you just load file:///pathâ€¦/index.html using the browser? Why or why not?

    You can, but since index.html is importing most of it's content, nothing will show up since the browser isn't able to import bundle.js

In webpack.config.js, what does the loader test entry test: /\.jsx?$/ do?

    The /\.jsx?$/ is a regular expression that matches .js and .jsx files, which the loader presumably bundles up into bundle.js.
