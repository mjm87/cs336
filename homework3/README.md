FAIR WARNING: the majority of this code-base will still be using the Comment terminology from lab10.
The code has been in part updated to reflect the trivial differences that are needed to display the
person/directory sort of information, but it has been sorta hacked onto / into.

Essentially: this is the mutant child of Lab10 and Homework2 and the necessity of deadlines, which works but would need serious revisions (in terminology at least) if there were to be a Homework4 building upon this...

ALSO: Note if you're looking for the addPerson.html and getPerson.html static files, I simply copied them over into the dist/ directory since public no longer existed in lab10. There functionality is sorta replaced by the REACT frontend.
