                        Node.js is a platform for server side javascript and easily facilitates the use of modules 
                        (like Express.js) to make things even easier for web developers. Express.js is a module 
                        for node that provides an easy interface for creating servers. Much much easier than the 
                        equivalent pure node.js code required.

                        The package.json file seems to store relevant metadate for the "myapp" web application: 
                        basic stuff like the name, author, and a short description of the app alongside stuff 
                        like a list of dependencies and a list of custom scripts that can be added to enable 
                        things like "npm start".
                </li>
                </ul>

                        The files are static in the sense that there doesn't seem to be any "live" updating without 
                        the user manually refreshing the page. Sure, with Javascript and stuff you can make the page
                        feel more dynamic than a static image or a pure html/css webpage, but the content being served 
                        up is the same until the user requests a version from the server.

                        Since I have my helloworld message popping up on the /hello route, it still shows up when I 
                        navigate there, and doesn't when I'm not. However, after having created an index.html in 
                        myapp's public directory, the root route / seems to only direct to this index.html and any 
                        helloworld like messages I'm sending no longer appear. Though after temporarily renaming 
                        this index.html, I am once again seeing the outputed text I expected.
