Web Development Vision Statement
--------------------------------

Partners: Alistair Van Maren and Michel Momeyer

Goal: to create a website which provides statistical and procedural insight into a piece of code.

Someone can upload some code to this website which is then analyzed and charts and graphs are displayed to the user.
The analysis could include simple things like the number of usages of a variable or average length of a function.
Potentially, it might be interesting to allow the user to create custom statistics to track: by giving some more general functions that would be able to count / measure / etc code snippets defined by a regular expression.
We might also be interested in doing some more procedural analysis to help determine what a segment of code is doing to aid software developers who haven't written the code (at least not recently) to help figure out what the code is doing.
This could include stuff like tracing a variable's use throughout a program or some sort of visualization of how a segment of code interacts with other bits of code. It'd be really cool, though perhaps out of scope for this project to provide an interpreter/debugger that allows you to supply parameters to a function and watch how the code manipulates them line by line.

The hope for this sort of application is to provide a tool to help provide a nudge to follow style-guidelines and to provide tools for developers to speed up the process of becoming familiar with code written by another developer.
