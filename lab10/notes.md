Note to myself
--------------

Make sure that node_modules is populated with all the things I need.
When in doubt, just run npm install and double check package.json to see if something in particular is missing.

Make sure to initialize the MongoDB password environment variable
export MONGO_PASSWORD=course-password

Double-check that .babelrc has been copied over. Since it's a hidden file, it sometimes can disappear.
