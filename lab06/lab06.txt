Exercise 6.1 A

Perhaps there's some fancy way of using the browser to handle other HTTP requests, but the only one I could find without writing client-side JS was GET.
I was able to GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD, etc through curl

curl -X GET localhost:3000/requests
curl -X HEAD localhost:3000/requests
curl -d data=Something -X PUT localhost:3000/requests
curl -d data=Something -X POST localhost:3000/requests
curl -d data=Something -X DELETE localhost:3000/requests

also by post-fixing --head I was able to look at the HTTP response header itself

curl -X OPTIONS localhost:3000/requests returned the NOT_IMPLEMENTED status as expected

It appears that the browser is really just designed to pull the data from the webserver, instead of being designed as an interface to upload/modify the webserver.
Of course there are ways around that, many of which we'll need to use to create proper SPA's but weren't intentionally built in with Sir Berners Lee's initial design.
I didn't verify this, but curl's GET command might not do so well with pictures and probably wouldn't apply styling, whihc is obviously better suited for the web browser.


Exercise 6.1 B

I think the most applicable response code for pages that aren't defined by an express route would be the generic 404 if you are in fact looking for a page that doesn't exist.
If the request type you send isn't supported but the route/path is defined, NOT_IMPLEMENTED (501) seems to be more appropriate.



Exercise 6.2 A

HTTP forms support GET and POST directly.

Exercise 6.2 B

The form data appears to be being sent back something like the following:

user_name=Michel&user_mail=mjm87%40students.calvin.edu&user_message=Helloworld%0D%0A

which looks like some strange formatting. 
I can't tell from my sample data if the data has been modified, but there might be some special characters I wasn't thinking about.
Those might just be a part of the JSON unlike format?
